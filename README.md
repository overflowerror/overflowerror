### Hi there :wave:

My name is Flow, I am a CS student from Germany.

When I'm not working on bigger (serious) projects I like doing stupid stuff in languages that are not meant to do any of that - it's a nice challenge. :yum:

My favorite programming languages are Java, Go and C, but I enjoy learning new languages as well.

Contributions to my projects are always welcome. :smile:
